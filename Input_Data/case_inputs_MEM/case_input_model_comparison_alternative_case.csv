MEM case input file,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
This area above the <CASE> flag is for notes, etc.,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
Under key word definition, undefined keywords may be any number of spaces, or a null string,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
Note that demand has no decisions.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Note that unmet demand is represented a source with a variable cost only, so unmet demand has an output decision.,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
REQUIRED KEYWORDS,,,,,,,,,,,,
tech_name,Name of technology, must be unique,,,,,,,,,,,
tech_type,One of 'non-dispatchable generator', 'generator', 'curtailment', 'lost_load', 'storage',  'transfer', or 'transmission',,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
OPTIONAL KEYWORDS,,,,,,,,,,,,
node_to,Name of node from which this technology would get or give its energy (or in the case of transmission, the receiving node),,,,,,,,,,,
node_from,Name of auxially node, e.g., node from transmission will get its energy,,,,,,,,,,,
series_file,Pointer to time series file that will ultimately get loaded under the keyword <series>,,,,,,,,,,,
normalization,Possible non-negative number. If 'normalization' is defined, then the series associated with that tech (defined by series_file) is transformed to have a mean equal to the number supplied,,,,,,,,,,,
capacity,Option to specify the capacity of a technology. If this number is supplied, then the technology capacity is fixed and is not included as a decision variable in the optimization,,,,,,,,,,,
fixed_cost,"Fixed cost, must be defined if n_capacity > 0",,,,,,,,,,,
var_cost,"Variable cost, must be defined if n_dispatch_in > 0 or n_dispatchout > 0",,,,,,,,,,,
charging_time,Possible contraint for case when n_capacity = 1, n_dispatch_in =1 and n_dispatch_out = 1 (e.g., battery),,,,,,,,,,,
efficiency,"Possible factor for case when n_capacity = 1, n_dispatch_in =1 and n_dispatch_out = 1 (e.g., battery), applied on way in to reservoir, also known as round trip efficiency",,,,,,,,,,,
decay_rate,Possible decay rate for storage in units of fraction per time step,,,,,,,,,,,
